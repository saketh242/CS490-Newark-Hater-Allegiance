      The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. 
      [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. 
      [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. 
      The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. 
      The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.</h1> */}
